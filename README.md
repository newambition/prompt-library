# PromptLi: Your Personal AI Prompt Engineering Toolkit

PromptLi is a dedicated application designed to help you efficiently manage, test, and refine your prompts for Large LanguageModels (LLMs). It provides a structured environment to move beyond scattered notes and documents, enabling a more systematic approach to prompt engineering.

The core value of PromptLi is to streamline your prompt development workflow, enhance the quality and consistency of your AI interactions, and provide a robust system for experimentation and iteration.

## What PromptLi Does: Core Features

PromptLi offers a comprehensive suite of tools to manage the lifecycle of your AI prompts:

* **Centralized Prompt Library:**
    * Organize all your prompts with custom titles, detailed notes, and flexible, color-coded tagging for easy search and retrieval.

* **Robust Version Control:**
    * Automatically track changes to your prompts with a built-in versioning system. Each version can have its own notes, LLM provider, and model ID logged.
    * **Pro Tier:** Enhanced version control features, including named versions and the ability to branch prompts for parallel experimentation.

* **Integrated Testing Playground:**
    * Test your prompts directly within the application using various LLMs.
    * Supports multiple providers like Gemini, OpenAI, and Anthropic.
    * Select specific model IDs for granular testing (e.g., `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`, `gpt-4-turbo`).
    * Edit prompts and save successful tests as new versions seamlessly.

* **Prompt Templates:**
    * Utilize a library of pre-built templates for various tasks (Marketing, Development, etc.) to get started quickly or find inspiration.

* **Secure API Key Management (BYOK):**
    * Securely store your personal API keys for different LLM providers. Keys are encrypted and only used for your testing in the playground.

* **Data Export (Pro Tier):**
    * Download your prompts and their versions in common formats like JSON and XML for backup or use in other systems.
